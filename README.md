# OSX-Toolbox 2

OS X Toolbox is a single view application that does some useful commands which helped me personally save a lot of time.
This app was made in 2012. The code is not good (for example to free ram it uses sudo purge) but for me personally it's fine.

App is written in Applescript.

**Options**

- Free Ram
- Quit All Apps
- Show hidden files
- Unhide Library folder
- Disable Resume after Login
- Hide All Apps
- Disable Notification Centre
- Add a folder to the dock with the last used Applications
- Highlight stack items in dock on hover 
- Save Screenshot as

**Note**

- To make use of the Quit All applications option, create a automater application with the Quit All Applications action and place it in /Applications. I have included a copy I made.

Disclaimer: 2012, 6 year old code. May not function as intended or may be poorly written.
