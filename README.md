# OSX-Toolbox 2

OS X Toolbox is a single view application that does some useful commands which helped me personally save a lot of time.
This app was made in 2012. The code is not good (for example to free ram it uses sudo purge) but for me personally it's fine.

App is written in Applescript.

Disclaimer: 2012, 6 year old code. May not function as intended or may be poorly written.
